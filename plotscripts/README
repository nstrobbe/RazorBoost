*************************
** getBGcomposition.py ** 
*************************

Run as: 
	python getBGcomposition.py <samplesfile>
With:
	samplefile: file containing all the samples you want to run over

Things to modify in the script:
	* integrated luminosity, is set to 19789 pb-1 
	* location of the root files with the count histograms

Output of the script:
	* file cutflow.tex containing the cutflow in latex format
	* on screen: cut flow in event counts, percentages and the TTbar composition


***********************
** getDataMCplots.py **
***********************

Run as: 
	python getDataMCplots.py <outputdir>
With:
	outputdir: directory where you want the plots to be stored

Things to modify in the script:
	* integrated luminosity if you want to change this from how you ran the analyzer
	* datasets you want to include. 
	* location of the root files containing the histograms
	* Cut strings if you change those

***********************
** get2Dplots.py **
***********************

Run current version as: 
        python get2Dplots.py <outputdir> <bg histo dir> (<data histo dir>)
With: 
        outputdir: directory where you want the plots to be stored
	bg histo dir: directory containing the rzrBoostMC_bg.root file
	data histo dir: directory containing the rzrBoostMC_data.root file, 
	     	   	can be omitted if it is the same as <bg histo dir>

Things to modify in the script:
       * integrated luminosity if you want to change this from how you ran the analyzer
       * name of the analyzer you ran, default is "rzrBoostMC"
       * name of the outputfile, default is "2Dplots.root"
       * Cut strings if you changed those
       * Specific (extra) plots to make

***********************
** getShapePlots.py **
***********************

Run current version as: 
        python getShapePlots.py <outputdir> <infile1> <infile2> <infile3>
With: 
        outputdir: directory where you want the plots to be stored
	infile1,2,3: three inputfiles currently corresponding to total BG, QCD, TTJets

Things to modify in the script:
       * integrated luminosity if you want to change this from how you ran the analyzer
       * name of the outputfile, default is "shapeplots.root"
       * Specific plots to make

Additional information: 
       * Information about the histogram is passed along to the plot function through a dictionary
         It takes the following form:
	    dict["name"] = [histogram, 
            		    color,
         		    plot title,
                 	    Used as reference plot in ratio?]
